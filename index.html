        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements. The elements that holds all of the children is known as the parent element. </li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>
          <li>Make sure to use heading tags in order</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about webpage that the browser uses toserve webpage users. Typically not seen by users, but contains important info about accessibility, search engines, and performace.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive. HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li> head contains the meta data for web application.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, we can use the following metadata tags</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles. Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, /head). We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file. The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. </li>
          <li></li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets , CSS, which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
        <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Theyre useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
        <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading</li>
        <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
        <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
        <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
        <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
        <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
        <li>* use this to declare that ALL of the elements onthe page will have the style properties</li>
        <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
        <li> when we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. Just because our files are in the same project repository doesnt mean they know about each other. To do this, we will use the HTML link element.</li>
        <li>In the preceding statement, a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        <li.>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
          <li>-A		 flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>we identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>Every project in Github is called a repository or repo for short, a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision.</li>
          <li>Branch, workspace where you can make changes that dont effect the live site.</li>

          <li>An SSH key is an access credential for the secure shell (SSH) network protocol. Generating SSH keys allows developers to interface with certain remote services without having to constantly retype login information. This will be especially helpful as we begin to use another tool, GitHub. GitHub is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code. GitHub is connected to Git, which is software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code.</li>

          <li>A graphical user interface (GUI) is a way for users to interact with the computer visually. Before GUIs, users had to type in specific commands to the terminal to communicate with the computer. Using graphics to make it easier for the user to interact with a device was first popularized by the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s.</li>
          <li>An IDE contains many essential tools needed for code development such as a source code editor, local build automation, a debugger, and the ability to extend the IDE's capabilities with extensions to meet specific development needs.</li>
          <li>During this course, we will be using a code editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write, view, and edit our code.</li>
          <li>Every git repo starts with a default branch named main</li>
          <li>from the main branch developers can create new branches to work in,when that work is done, these branches can be merged backinto the main branch.</li>
          <li>ultimately, the main branch will hold the final product of your project. Multiple branches can existata time, each serving a different purpose. for example, a feature branch might hold code that is currently being developed.</li>
          <li>it's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. Working on an outdated or stale version can lead to big sync problems.</li>
